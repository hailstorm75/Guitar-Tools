## Update
Currently the project is stale.

Since it was my first attempt at learning my ways around WPF, it is very unmaintainable, so I'll recreate this application once I'm finished with other projects.

## ❔ Description
Displays guitar scales on a fretboard with extended string and fret support.
Allows the user to select tuning, string amount, fret amount, scale type.
